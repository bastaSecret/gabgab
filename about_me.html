    <p class = "sentence">
        I am a 2nd year college student that is currently taking Information Technology with specialization in Mobile and Internet Technology. I enrolled in this course with only a rough idea about IT. I also don't have the same motivation and passion that the other students have enrolled in the same course as mine. IT wasn't my first choice but rather than my parents' choice because of the demand that it has in the industry may it be in a company or in the government. But about me, I never back down without a fight. If I found the task hard and I couldn't be able to do it right, I would go ask my friends that is knowledgable about the topic to teach me how to solve the problem. I always look for the bright side of things and make the most out of it.
